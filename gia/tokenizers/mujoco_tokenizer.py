    Tokenize episodes from MuJoCo environment.

    First, each floating point element of tensors in the observation sequence is mu-law companded as in WaveNet (Oord et al., 2016).
    Then, the tensors are discretized into integers in the range [0, nb_bins-1].
    Finally, the tensors are concatenated and shifted by token_shift. Tensors and actions are separated by SEP.

    Args:
        observations (Tensor): Observations
        actions (Tensor): Actions
        mu (float, optional): Î¼ parameter. Defaults to 100.
        M (float, optional): M parameter. Defaults to 256.
        nb_bins (int, optional): Number of bins for the discretization. Defaults to 1024.
        token_shift (int, optional): Shift tokens by this value. Defaults to 32000.

    Returns:
        Tensor: Tokenized episodes
