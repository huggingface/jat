# General Intelligent Agents

An open impementation of [GATO](https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent)


dev install  (Linux)
`pip install -e .[dev]`

Steps:

1. Creation of imitation learning data on the hub filter datasets for `prj_gia*`
2. Creation of tokenizer, model, training loop etc
3. Single env learning, e.g all Atari envs -> evaluation
4. Multi task learning, e.g Atari + MassiveText -> evaluation
5. Full tasks setting -> evaluation  <- we are here

More details to come!
